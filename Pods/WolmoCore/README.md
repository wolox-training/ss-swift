# WOLMO

WOLMO Core iOS is a framework which provides extensions and utilities for iOS commonly used at [Wolox](http://www.wolox.com.ar/).

At Wolox, we complement this framework with [Wolmo - Reactive Core](https://github.com/Wolox/wolmo-reactive-core-ios).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To use Wolmo Core in your project, update CocoaPods to version 1.10.2 or newer, and add this line to your `Podfile`.

```
pod 'WolmoCore'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```
To download wolmo-core-ios, add this to your Cartfile:
```
github "Wolox/wolmo-core-ios" ~> 4.1.0
```

### Manually
[Bootstrap](#bootstrap) the project and then drag it to your workspace.

## Usage

The framework is divided into 2 sections: Utilities and Extensions.

The main difference between them is that `utilities` represent components that are independent of the existance of another component. On the other hand, `extensions` represent extra functionality for other existent components. Extensions exist only because the components they rely on exists.
